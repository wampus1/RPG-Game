# TESSERA

A 2.5D top-down, grid-based RPG with a heavy retro look: procedural pixel-art
sprites, an ASCII-character UI that dissolves and re-forms when windows open,
and a WebGL CRT screen with scanlines, curvature and a soft glow.

Every world is generated from a seed: stretched and morphed biome splotches,
rivers, lakes, mountains and forests; civilizations with their own cultures;
villages, towns and walled cities full of villagers who live out daily
schedules.

No dependencies and no build step: it's plain JavaScript modules and a canvas.

## Running

```sh
npm start          # serves the folder on http://localhost:8080
```

Any static web server works (the game uses ES modules, so it must be served
over HTTP rather than opened as a `file://`). Then open the page and press
**N** on the title screen for a random world, or **S** to type a seed.

```sh
npm test           # world generation, settlement and NPC simulation tests
```

Useful URL parameters for testing: `?autostart&seed=123` skips the title
screen, `&time=1320` starts at 22:00, `&goto=city` (or a settlement name, a
style like `sun`, or `abandoned`) teleports you there, and `&nocrt` starts
with the CRT effect off. `window.__game` exposes the running game.

## Controls

| Action | Keys |
| --- | --- |
| Move (tile by tile) | WASD / arrow keys, hold Shift to sprint |
| Select belt slot | 1–9 or mouse wheel |

## What's in the world

**Rendering.** The world is a grid of cubes: x/z across the map and 16
vertical layers. It's drawn in an oblique 3/4 view (each cube shows its top
and its south face) with the painter's algorithm, hidden-face culling, soft
edge shading, and entities sorted into the rows they stand in. Walking indoors
cuts the roof and upper walls away so you can see inside; anything that hides
you fades out and can be clicked through. Lighting is a flood-filled light map
(walls block it, windows and open doors let it spill) sampled per visible
surface in screen space, over a day/night sky colour. Torches and lanterns glow
at night, chimneys smoke, weather drifts between clear skies, rain, snow and
fog, and the whole frame goes through the CRT shader.

**World map.** Each map square is one region of 2×2 screens (64×36 tiles).
Biomes are splotches: jittered seed points with random stretch and rotation,
evaluated through a domain-warped distance field, so shapes are irregular and
can be sampled both per map square and per tile. The continent is ringed by
ocean with beaches; mountain splotches become ridged ranges; rivers flow
downhill from the highlands to the sea (or pool into lakes) and meander at tile
level. Press M for the map: it fills in as you explore, villagers' rumours
reveal distant places, and V shows civilization territories.

**Biomes.** Plains, forest, taiga, tundra, desert, savanna, jungle, swamp,
mountains, beach and ocean. Each has its own ground blocks with patchy floor
variants, trees (oak, birch, pine, snowy pine, palm, jungle, acacia, willow,
dead trees, cacti), plants (grass, ferns, flowers, bushes, berries, reeds,
mushrooms, herbs), rocks, ponds or swamp pools, and ores underground.

**Settlements.** Villages (1 map square), towns (2) and walled cities (2×2)
belong to civilizations whose culture (Valeborn, Nordvolk, Sunreach,
Verdani, Kharduum) sets the names and building style. Materials also depend on
the local biome (log cabins and snowy roofs in the north, adobe with flat,
cluttered rooftops in the desert, stone and slate in the highlands). The
settlement's condition matters too: prosperous places get glass windows,
cobbled roads, lamp posts and flower beds; poor ones get cracked and mossy
walls, holes in the roof and dirt roads; abandoned villages are cobwebbed ruins
with loot and monsters at night. Rivers get plank bridges, and water gets piers
and fishing spots. There are houses sized to each household, taverns,
temples with graveyards, smithies, shops, bakeries, libraries, town halls,
guardhouses with training dummies, manors, farms with fenced fields and
scarecrows, market stalls, wells and statues, all furnished inside.

**Villagers.** Population depends on the settlement's size, condition and
culture. Every villager gets a job (farmer, guard, blacksmith, innkeeper,
merchant, priest, scholar, fisher, miner, lumberjack, noble…), a personality
(bravery, sociability, diligence, temper, kindness and early-bird/night-owl
leanings, shown as traits), one to three hobbies (fishing, reading, music,
dice, praying, gardening, sword practice, stargazing…), equipment from their
job and hobbies, a home and a workplace. Only families (partners, children and
grandparents) share a home. Schedules are built from all of this and offset
per person: sleep, breakfast, commute, work, lunch at home or the tavern,
hobbies, dinner, evening socializing and a weekly rest day. Villagers path
tile by tile, open and close doors, claim seats, beds and work spots, and show
what they're doing with little emotes.

When threatened, villagers decide based on personality and job: the brave
fight back, others shout for the guards (who come running and pursue whoever
is responsible) and the timid run home. Attack a villager and you're wanted in
that settlement for a while.

**Player.** Walk tile by tile, mine with tools or bare hands (blocks drop
items you pick up by walking over them), place blocks and rotate asymmetric
ones, switch the working layer, fight, toss items, craft at a workbench,
furnace or anvil, trade with shopkeepers, eat, sleep in beds to skip the
night and set your spawn point, and save your game (Esc → Save).
